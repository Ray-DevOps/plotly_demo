# This manifest file creates 3 kubernetes objects.

# First, it creates a deployment for the python application

# Second, it creates a nodeport service to expose the application on the cluster nodes

# finally, it creates a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale the pods such that pod CPU utilization stays at 50%
